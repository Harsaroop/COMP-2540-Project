# Share-Your-Wheels

We are a group of classmates who developed this project as a part of their school work. 
The goal of our project is :- 
Since the pollution is increasing and touching new highs, as responsible
inhabitants of this planet known as Earth 1, it is our duty to take care
of our environment which goes without saying. Hence, as students, and
developers, we came up with a basic solution to a small part of the
problem, which is a start! We are developing a project, a significant one.
That may help us change the world. The goal of this project is to
encourage people to do carpooling more often than not; let's propose a
situation where there are a couple of people, maybe strangers, who are
cool with the concept of car-pooling. Here's Mr. A, who wants to head
from Downtown to University. Now, Mr. A knows Mr. X and Mr. Q who
wants to visit the City center and the mall, respectively. So, Mr. A
inputs the same; and with the power of Graphs and Priority queues,
wonders of Kruskal's Algorithms, inputs of pickups and
endpoints, the result is the shortest route Mr. A can use so 3 people, if
not more can reach their desired destination with consuming fuel for
only one car, rather than more. Hence, saving the gas and the world for
us and our future generations, with an intent of a less polluted
environment of our planet.
